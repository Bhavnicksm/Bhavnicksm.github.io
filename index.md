I am Bhavnick and I am interested in making computers learn our language.
<br/> <br/>
Ever since I was introduced to computers and their coding 'Languages' I have been hooked. I can't remember a time when I did not want to be someone who worked with and on computers. I learnt C++, HTML and CSS in school and built my own E-Book Reader (I also love reading :heart:). In college, when I was first introduced to Artificial Intelligence, I learnt Python, did multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses, and even worked on a few Kaggle datasets, all in less than a year.
<br/> <br/>
My love for reading and of witty puns eventually lead me to combine my interest in computers and language, to the present moment.
<br/> <br/>
I am majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, currently focusing on the topics of Data Mining, Natural Language Processing and Speech signal processing. I am quite research-oriented and am doing my Bachelor's Thesis in NLP.
<br/> <br/>
I also love blogging about AI, my successes and failings and everything in between.
