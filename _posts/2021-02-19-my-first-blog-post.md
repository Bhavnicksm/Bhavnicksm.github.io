This is a test blog in which I check out the various elements of MarkDown posts. Here I make a list of examples of different ways to use markdown and how it looks with the [Minimal-Mistakes]() theme for my own benefit as well as yours. I tend to forget things that I don't use daily quite easily, markdown being one of them, therefore this post.

# Headings (a heading 1 btw)

```
    # heading 1
    ## heading 2
    ### heading 3
    #### heading 4

## Code (a heading 2 btw)

``` 
    Indent and place some code below. For example:
