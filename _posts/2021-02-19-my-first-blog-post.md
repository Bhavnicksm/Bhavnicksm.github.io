This is a test blog in which I check out the various elements of MarkDown posts. Here I make a list of examples of different ways to use markdown and how it looks with the [Minimal-Mistakes]() theme for my own benefit as well as yours. I tend to forget things that I don't use daily quite easily, markdown being one of them, therefore this post. Hope this can provide you help.

# Index 



# Headings (a heading 1 btw)

To write a heading, you need to use the hashtag ('#') before the text with the number of hashtags signifying the heading hierarchy. Equivaltent to `<h1> - <h6>` in html.

```
    # heading 1
    ## heading 2
    ### heading 3
    #### heading 4
    ##### heading 5
    ###### heading 6
```

## Code (a heading 2 btw)

Note that ` is an accent comma (found below the tilde ~ on the keyboard), which is different from the inverted comma '. This is a commonly made error. 

```text
    Indent and place some code below. For example:
    ```python
        import numpy as np
        print(np.random.choice(['Hi', 'Bye']))
    ```
```
